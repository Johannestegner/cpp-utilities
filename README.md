cpp-utilities
=============

My C++ Utilities library.  
Please note: I have not been working with C++ for a long time, so this library is partially for me to re-learn the C++ language, and also to store data structures and other stuff that I can (and hopefully will) have use for in my other C++ projects.  
  
Feel free to fork and help out if there is any functionallity you like or want to extend.  
Post a issue or do whatever.  
Pull-requests will be reviewed whenever I got time!
